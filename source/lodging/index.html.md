## Staying There

*Where should you stay? Well, there are several options.*

*Option the First:* [Kingsley Mill Manor](http://www.kingsleymillmanor.com/), where the wedding will take place, has sleeping accomodations for up to 16 people. Since the house will be busy with activity the weekend of the wedding, we would encourage our younger friends to stay on-site and party with us. There will be plenty of floor-space for our Vermont friends who don’t feel like driving home to Burlington after the wedding on Saturday night as well (floor space will be BYOBlankets).

*Option the Second:* For a more peaceful experience, here are a few other places to stay in Middlebury (a short 20 minutes from Kingsley Manor):

- [Courtyard Marriott Hotel](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/btvcy-courtyard-middlebury/)
- [Downtown Middlebury B&B - Inn on the Green](http://www.innonthegreen.com/)
- [Downtown Middlebury B&B - A Room in the Village](http://www.aroominthevillage.com/)

*Option the Third:* There are also several vacation rental homes within the Lake Dunmore area if you’d like to stay with a group. Great websites for finding a vacation rental are [AirBnB](www.airbnb.com), [VactionRentals.com](www.vacationrentals.com), and [VRBO](www.vrbo.com).
