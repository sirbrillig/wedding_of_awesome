# Gifts

Seriously, your presence, love and support on our wedding day is gift enough! Please do not feel any obligation to purchase a gift for us. If you are still moved to give us something tangible though, here are some suggestions:

*Donation:* We would be thrilled if you would consider giving a donation to one of these non-profit organizations that are near and dear to our hearts:

- The Humane Society of Chittenden County <http://chittendenhumane.org/>
- Brookline Tai Chi <http://brooklinetaichi.org/>

*Registry:* If you’d like to give us a more traditional gift, we have registered at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/1EX6KW1VF8LRM) for a few items that would help make our little apartment feel more homey. 

*Personal:* If you are crafty/artsy/inspired to give us something small that’s not on this list, by all means go for it!

*Monetary:* Lastly, someday in the near future we hope to be settled enough to A) go on a honeymoon and B) buy a house and furnish it. A monetary gift toward our future goals would be very much appreciated.
